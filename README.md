# Goal for this Project
Hello, my goal for this project is to make a site that lets you randomly donate to charity without having to do research and pick one which I personly find makes it harder to find one and also leaves me with a slight feeling of guilt for helping one cause and not another

I plan on making a home page with basic information about the site and places to contact me and make the donations themself


## User Goals
* Looks good with clear text.
* Everything is clear on what it does and how to use it.
* Feels smooth with little to no useless space.
## Site owners Goals
* Help others make random donations with ease.
* Make sure it has a good accesabilty score.
### Requirements
* Easy and fast to make donations.
* Make sure everything is clear on what it does
* Have a way to contact me
### Expectations
* That all links and navigations work as intended.
* That you can actully make donations via paypal (try to make it automaticly make donations but that would be another free time project for me to work on)
* Everything looks good on diffrent screen sizes

## Design Choices

### The Colors
#00194c text
#9f540f bg
#553261 text
#6d9461 bg

### Font choices
To make it all alittle diffrent I used fonts from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/ "Google Fonts") and decided to go for [Roboto Slab](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto+Slab?query=rob "Roboto Slab font") for the basic text as I feel it looks clean and just sits right with me while I went with [Roboto](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto "Roboto font") for my h1,h2 because it goes well with Roboto Slab and has the same clean look that I

# Testing
For testing I have navigated through all the combinations of actions you could do and tried to push it,
everything respons properly to diffrent screen sizes and is just as accesible and clear with no issues at all,
during testing I noticed that the paypal feature I added was creating errors on the W3C Validator so I tried to resolve this issue but
even with the normal code given by paypal it wouldn't let you log in which I found very strange.

## Validator Test

### HTML
* No errors going through the offical 
### CSS
* No errors going through the offical

## Unfixed Bugs
Bug with paypal option not letting you log in and says that some details are missing even when using the default code provided by paypal
This was not fixed due to lack of time and as of now lack of knowledge over it

# Deployment
The site was deployed onto github by uploading the code into a github repository and from there making the repository public so I could go into the page tab in the settings, from there selecting the source as the master branch and saving.
