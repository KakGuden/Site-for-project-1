# Goal for this Project
Hello, my goal for this project is to make a site that lets you randomly donate to charity without having to do research and pick one which I personly find makes it harder to find one and also leaves me with a slight feeling of guilt for helping one cause and not another

I plan on making a home page with basic information about the site and places to contact me and make the donations themself


## User Goals
* Looks good with clear text.
* Everything is clear on what it does and how to use it.
* Feels smooth with little to no useless space.
## Site owners Goals
* Help others make random donations with ease.
* Make sure it has a good accesabilty score.
### Requirements
* Easy and fast to make donations.
* Make sure everything is clear on what it does
* Have a way to contact me
### Expectations
* That all links and navigations work as intended.
* That you can actully make donations via paypal (try to make it automaticly make donations but that would be another free time project for me to work on)
* Everything looks good on diffrent screen sizes

## Design Choices

### The Colors
#00194c text
#9f540f bg
#553261 text
#6d9461 bg

### Font choices
To make it all alittle diffrent I used fonts from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/ "Google Fonts") and decided to go for [Roboto Slab](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto+Slab?query=rob "Roboto Slab font") for the basic text as I feel it looks clean and just sits right with me while I went with [Roboto](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto "Roboto font") for my h1,h2 because it goes well with Roboto Slab and has the same clean look that I
